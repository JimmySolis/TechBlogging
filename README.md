  ## How it works:

  ### 1) I make sure I have a server that connects all my routes, api's, and db.

  ### 2) Then have a connection file that holds the variables to connect to the db.

  ### 3) Once online I have made routes that hit certain points to get the user what they need.

   ### 4) In the back end I also have models, public folder, and views folder that create the app. They hold handlebar and extentions of sequile modles that make it easy for me to create the models I used for the user, posts, and comments.
